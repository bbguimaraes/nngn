Documentation
-------------

Documentation generated from comments using `Doxygen` is available
[here](https://bbguimaraes.com/nngn/docs).  It can of course also be read inline
in the source code.  Source code is organized in the following directories:

- [`src`](https://bbguimaraes.com/nngn/docs/dir_68267d1309a1af8e8297ef4c3efbcdba.html):
  main source code directory.  Most of the code is contained in one of the
  subdirectories, which form mostly-independent modules.
- `scripts`: auxiliary scripts for building and interacting with the program.
- `tests`: unit and integration tests for the C++ and Lua components.

Building
--------

All targets use `autotools`.  For a native binary, simply execute:

```sh
./configure
make
```

See [dependencies](#dependencies) for the required packages.

The following build environments are regularly tested and known to work:

- Linux with GCC/Clang
- [FreeBSD with GCC/Clang](#freebsd)
- [Windows with `mingw`](#mingw)

### MinGW

Cross-compiling with `mingw` is supported with the usual `configure` arguments:

```sh
./configure --build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 # â€¦
```

### Dependencies

The default build of the program is very minimal.  Additional functionality can
be enabled by passing extra flags to the `configure` script.

See [scripts/container.sh](./scripts/container.sh) for an example script that
creates a container with all the build dependencies.

#### `--with-glfw`

Enables the graphical user interface.  Requires:

- `glfw` (3.3): portable GUI library

#### Tests

Building the tests requires `Qt5Core` and `Qt5Test` (5.14.0) and can be enabled
with the `--enable-tests` flag.  A `clang-tidy` check is also available via
`make tidy`.

The tests can be compiled and executed with several compiler protections and
sanitizers.

The following compilers have been tested:

- `gcc` (11.1.0)
- `clang` (12.0.1)

The following compiler flags have been tested:

- `-D_GLIBCXX_SANITIZE_VECTOR`
- `-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope`
- `-fstack-protector`

The following sanitizers have been tested:

- `address`
- `leak`
- `undefined`
- `pointer-compare`
- `pointer-subtract`

#### FreeBSD

The packages required for a minimal build in FreeBSD are (available as pre-built
packages via `pkg`):

- `autoconf`
- `automake`
- `gcc11`
- `pkgconf`
